== Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in the Rhodium Standard community a *harassment-free, emotionally safe experience* for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an *open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community* that embodies the principles of the Campaign for Cooler Coding and Programming (CCCP).

== Our Standards

=== Examples of Behavior That Contributes to a Positive Environment

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
* **Embracing reversibility**: Treating mistakes as learning opportunities, not permanent failures
* **Supporting experimentation**: Encouraging trying new approaches without fear of judgment
* **Assuming good intent**: Giving others the benefit of the doubt in ambiguous situations
* **Sharing knowledge**: Helping others learn and grow in their skills
* **Crediting contributions**: Properly attributing ideas, code, and assistance

===  Examples of Unacceptable Behavior

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* **Gatekeeping**: Dismissing or belittling others based on experience level, technology choices, or background
* **Shaming mistakes**: Publicly ridiculing errors, especially from learners
* **Attribution stripping**: Removing credit from others' work
* **Bad faith participation**: Deliberately wasting community time with disingenuous questions or arguments
* **Doxxing or threats**: Any form of intimidation or privacy violation
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

=== CCCP-Specific Values

Our community particularly values:

* **Emotional Safety**: We recognize that coding can be stressful. We support each other in managing that stress.
* **Offline-First Respect**: We don't expect immediate responses. People have lives, internet access varies, and asynchronous communication is valid.
* **Technology Pluralism**: We don't enforce technology choices beyond RSR requirements. Your editor, OS, and tools are your choice.
* **Principled Disagreement**: We can disagree on technical matters while respecting each other as people.
* **Solidarity Over Competition**: We succeed together, not at each other's expense.

== Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

== Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official project email address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Contributing code, documentation, or other materials to the project
* Participating in GitLab issues, merge requests, or discussions
* Participating in Matrix channels or other community forums

This Code of Conduct also applies to behavior outside community spaces when such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members.

== Reporting

=== How to Report

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by one of the following methods:

* **Email**: code-of-conduct@rhodium-standard.org
* **Confidential GitLab Issue**: Use a confidential issue with label `~code-of-conduct`
* **Direct Contact**: Message any core maintainer listed in MAINTAINERS.md

All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

=== What to Include in a Report

To help us address the situation effectively, please include:

* **Your contact information** (optional if you wish to remain anonymous)
* **Names (usernames, real names) of individuals involved**
* **Description of the behavior** and when/where it occurred
* **Links or screenshots** as evidence (if applicable)
* **Whether the situation is ongoing**
* **Any other relevant context**
* **Whether you've already taken any action** (e.g., asked them to stop)

=== Reporting to Multiple People

If you don't feel comfortable reporting to the default CoC email or team, you can report to:

* Any core maintainer individually (see MAINTAINERS.md)
* An external mediator (if requested, we will arrange)
* Law enforcement (for illegal activity - we support your choice)

== Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

=== 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

**Timeline**: Warning issued within 48 hours of report.

=== 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**Timeline**: Warning and interaction restriction issued within 72 hours.

**Duration**: Typically 1-4 weeks depending on severity.

=== 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

**Timeline**: Ban issued within 5 days of report (may be expedited for serious violations).

**Duration**: Typically 1-6 months. After the ban period:
* Banned individual may apply for reinstatement
* Application reviewed by CoC team
* Community input considered
* Reinstatement requires unanimous CoC team approval

=== 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

**Review**: Permanent bans are reviewed annually. In extraordinary circumstances (genuine rehabilitation, community support), bans may be reconsidered, but this requires:
* Written application explaining growth and change
* Support from community members
* Unanimous approval from core team + 2/3 community vote
* Probationary period with restrictions

=== Special Cases

==== Security Violations

Violations involving security (doxxing, credential theft, etc.):
* Immediate temporary ban while investigation proceeds
* Law enforcement contacted if illegal
* Permanent ban highly likely

==== Repeated Minor Violations

Pattern of minor violations (3+ corrections):
* Escalate to warning or temporary ban
* Focus on behavior pattern, not individual incidents

==== Off-Platform Behavior

Behavior outside our platforms may be considered if:
* It affects community member safety
* It involves community members
* It relates to project representation

== Investigation Process

1. **Report Received** (Day 0)
   * Acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
   * Assign CoC response team (2 core maintainers, not involved in incident)

2. **Initial Assessment** (Days 1-3)
   * Review evidence
   * Interview reporter (if contactable)
   * Determine if immediate action needed

3. **Investigation** (Days 3-7)
   * Interview witnesses
   * Interview reported person (give them chance to respond)
   * Gather additional evidence
   * Consult with core team if needed

4. **Decision** (Days 7-10)
   * CoC team determines appropriate response
   * Notify reported person of decision and reasoning
   * Notify reporter of outcome (details limited for privacy)

5. **Implementation** (Immediately after decision)
   * Apply enforcement action
   * Document in private CoC log
   * Update public transparency report (anonymized)

6. **Appeal** (Days 10-30)
   * Reported person may appeal within 7 days
   * Different core maintainers review appeal
   * Appeal decision is final

== Appeals Process

If you believe you have been unfairly accused or sanctioned:

1. **Submit Appeal**
   * Email: code-of-conduct-appeals@rhodium-standard.org
   * Within 7 days of receiving enforcement decision
   * Explain why you believe the decision was unfair
   * Provide any additional context or evidence

2. **Appeal Review**
   * Reviewed by different core maintainers (not original CoC team)
   * Decision within 14 days
   * May uphold, modify, or reverse original decision

3. **Final Decision**
   * Appeal decision is final
   * Documented in CoC log
   * Parties notified

== Transparency & Accountability

=== Public Transparency Reports

We publish quarterly anonymized reports:

* Number of reports received
* Types of violations
* Outcomes (without identifying details)
* Lessons learned and policy updates

See: https://rhodium-standard.org/transparency/code-of-conduct

=== Private CoC Log

Core team maintains a private log containing:
* Full details of incidents
* Evidence and investigation notes
* Decisions and reasoning
* Follow-up actions

Access: Core maintainers + CoC response team only

=== Community Feedback

Annually, we:
* Solicit community feedback on CoC effectiveness
* Review enforcement decisions for consistency
* Update CoC as needed (requires governance process)
* Publish annual transparency report

== Moderator Guidelines

For community leaders enforcing this CoC:

=== Principles

* **Proportionality**: Response should match severity
* **Consistency**: Similar violations get similar responses
* **Transparency**: Document decisions and reasoning
* **Privacy**: Respect confidentiality of all involved
* **Recusal**: Step back if you have conflicts of interest
* **Empathy**: Recognize human complexity and potential for growth

=== Response Time SLA

* **Acknowledgement**: 24 hours
* **Urgent cases** (ongoing harassment, doxxing): Immediate temporary action, full investigation follows
* **Investigation**: 7 days for decision
* **Appeals**: 14 days for review

=== When to Escalate

Escalate to full core team when:
* You're unsure of appropriate response
* It involves a core maintainer
* It's a novel situation not covered by guidelines
* Reporter requests escalation

== Restorative Justice

When appropriate, we prefer restorative approaches:

* **Mediation**: Facilitated conversation between parties
* **Apology and amends**: Opportunity to make things right
* **Educational approach**: Help people learn from mistakes
* **Community service**: Contribution to project as reparation

Restorative justice is NOT appropriate for:
* Repeat offenders
* Serious violations (harassment, doxxing, threats)
* When victim opposes this approach

== Support for Targets

If you've been harassed or treated unfairly:

* You don't have to "forgive" or participate in restorative justice
* Your safety and comfort are priorities
* We will enforce boundaries with the other party
* We can help connect you to support resources
* You retain your standing in the community
